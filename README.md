# SRIP26-AI_for_Health

This Repository contains the solutions to the AI for Health Task to be done for applying to Sustainibility Lab for SRIP 26.

**Acknowledgement** : I have used the help of Google to search upon the documentations of libraries and help to find out what tool I can use for performing a certain action. I have also used Github Copilot for Identifying Syntax Errors and organize the code better. I have tried my best to do the Task myself and limit the usage of these tools.
